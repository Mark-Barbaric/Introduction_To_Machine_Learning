# Introduction_To_Machine_Learning
Course provided by City Lit which covers Machine Learning and Neural Network concepts and implementation using Python, Keras, Tensorflow and Numpy.

Session 1: Introduction To Machine Learning:
Quick history, how it is used today, and data pre-processing. Handling missing values, encoding variables etc. We will spend some time getting familiar with data frames in Python. Elements of natural language processing.

Session 2: Common regression and classification methods:
Emphasis on random forest and boosted decision trees. Basics of learning algorithms. How loss functions work and optimisation of these. Choices of hyperparameters.

Session 3: Artificial neural nets - how to determine neural net architecture and hyperparameters. Will briefly cover image processing and convolutional neural networks.

Session 4: Unsupervised machine learning and summary:
Explanation of some unsupervised learning methods with an emphasis on k-means clustering. Summary of common machine learning methods and outline of when to use what. Guidance on how to explore machine learning further.

Session 5: Neuro Linguistic Programming:
Explanation of NLP and demonstration of how to set up Support Vector Machines.

Final Assignment: Titanic Dataset
Task is to create a model which attempts to predict whether people would have survived the Titanic based on input data of age, sex, class etc. Created a Neural Net which had a prediction accuracy of 74%.
